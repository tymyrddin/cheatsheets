# Search for public information

## Search engines
* Google
* DuckDuckGo
* Ixquick (Startpage)
* Binsearch
* Shodan

Use multiple search engines as they may generate different results depending on when they crawled content and their algorithms. Also try Bing and Baidu for example. Both DuckDuckGo and ixquick (startpage) provide reduced information leakage about the tester.
