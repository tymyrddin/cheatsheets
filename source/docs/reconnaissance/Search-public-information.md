# Search for public information

* Use Search engines to understand what sensitive design and configuration information of the application/system/organisation is exposed both directly (on the organisation's website) or indirectly (on a third party website): 
  * Network diagrams and configurations
  * Archived posts and emails by administrators and other key staff
  * Log on procedures and username formats
  * Usernames and passwords
  * Error message content
  * Development, test, UAT and staging versions of the website
* Learn more about the organisation and people on finder sites and check public records

## Search engines
* Google
* DuckDuckGo
* Ixquick (Startpage)
* Binsearch
* Shodan

Use multiple search engines as they may generate different results depending on when they crawled content and their algorithms. Also try Bing and Baidu for example. Both DuckDuckGo and ixquick (startpage) provide reduced information leakage about the tester.
