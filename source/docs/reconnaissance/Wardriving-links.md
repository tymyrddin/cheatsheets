# WarDriving Links

* [Stumbler](http://www.netstumbler.com/) is a tool for Windows that facilitates detection of Wireless LANs using the 802.11b, 802.11a and 802.11g WLAN standards. It runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems from Windows 2000 to Windows XP. A trimmed-down version called MiniStumbler is available for the handheld Windows CE operating system. The program is commonly used for wardriving, verifying network configurations, finding locations with poor coverage in a WLAN, detecting causes of wireless interference, detecting unauthorized (“rogue”) access points and aiming directional antennas for long-haul WLAN links.
* [Wellenreiter](https://www.openhub.net/p/wellenreiter) is a wireless network discovery and auditing tool that supports Prism2, Lucent, and Cisco based cards. It is an easy to use Linux scanning tool. No card configuration has to be done and it is quite self-explanatory. It can discover networks (BSS/IBSS), and detects ESSID broadcasting or non-broadcasting networks and their WEP capabilities and the manufacturer automatically. DHCP and ARP traffic are decoded and displayed to give further information about the networks. An ethereal/tcpdump-compatible dumpfile and an Application savefile will be automatically created. Using a supported GPS device and the gpsd the location of the discovered networks can be tracked.
