Red team cheatsheets
================================================

Gathering some possibly (re)useful resources. We are not big fans of checklist approaches (though such can be handy when purpose of pentesting is to (dis)prove compliance to a set of rules). We prefer to understand how technologies work, instead of following some linearised process (which is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole anyhow), so our categorisation is somewhat arbitrary on occasion.

The resources also contain (links to) more/other resources for understanding how technologies work, aiding actual reasoning about security.
