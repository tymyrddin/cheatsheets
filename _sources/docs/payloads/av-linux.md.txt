# Linux antivirus

Linux-based malware is on the rise in 2022, and it is a problem for both home and enterprise users. You can no longer 
rely on best practices to keep Linux devices secure. A whole slew of new programs are coming into repositories 
around the web to tackle the latest malware threats, but a lot of them only make matters worse â€” some can even expose 
your system to serious malware infections.
